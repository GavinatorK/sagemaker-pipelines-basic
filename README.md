# Sagemaker Pipelines Starter Workshop

## Pipelines set up
In this section of the workshop, we will look at the mechanics of setting up a pipeline with steps from loading data, preprocessing, building and training a model, evaluating and registering and performing batch inference on Sagemaker Studio


## Pipelines Event Trigger with S3 upload

We will use the previously deployed pipeline and trigger it automatically when a new data file is uploaded using AWS Lambda, Amazon S3 and Sagemaker Python SDK.
